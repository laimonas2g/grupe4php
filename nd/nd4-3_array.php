/* Arrays - 15 Different Exercises (from easy to advanced) */

/* 1. Create an array of 20 elements (indices from 0 to 19) with random values from 10 to 50. */

/* 2. Using the array from exercise 1: */

/* 2. a) Count how many values in the array are odd numbers. */

/* 2. b) Find the smallest value in the array and its index or indices (if there are several). */

/* 2. c) Calculate the sum of all elements in the array. */

/* 2. d) Create a new array where each value is the difference between the original value and its index. */

/* 2. e) Add 5 more elements with random values from 10 to 50 to the array, so the total number of elements is 25. */

/* 2. f) Create two new arrays: one with values greater than 30, and one with values less than or equal to 30. */

/* 2. g) Change all values with indices divisible by 5 to -1 if they are less than 25. */

/* 2. h) Find the last index with a value greater than 40. */

/* 2. i) Use unset() to remove all elements whose indices are divisible by 3. */

/* 3. Generate an array of 100 elements, where each value is a random lowercase letter ('a' to 'd').
Count how many times each letter occurs. */

/* 4. Sort the array from exercise 3 in reverse alphabetical order. */

/* 5. Generate two arrays as in exercise 3. Merge both arrays, then count how many unique letters and unique 3-letter combinations exist. */

/* 6. Generate two arrays of 50 unique random integers from 100 to 199 (inclusive). */

/* 7. Generate an array with values that appear only in the first array of exercise 6 but not in the second. */

/* 8. Generate an array of values that appear in both arrays from exercise 6. */

/* 9. Create an associative array where keys are values from the first array of exercise 6,
and values are from the second array (by position). If arrays are of different lengths, stop at the shorter one. */

/* 10. Generate a 10-element array with the following rule: The first number is random from 1 to 10.
Each next number is the previous number multiplied by a random number from 2 to 4. */

/* 11. Generate a 30-element array of random numbers from 1 to 50.
Replace any even values with their half (integer division).
Sort the array in descending order. Find the sum of the first and last elements. */

/* 12. (Advanced) Generate a 2D array (6x6) where each value is a random number from 20 to 60.
Find the sum of all values in each row and each column. */

/* 13. (Advanced) Create an array of 25 random numbers from 1 to 30.
Create a new array where each value is the average of itself and its left and right neighbor.
For the first and last elements, use only two values (self and neighbor). Round averages to integers. */

/* 14. (Advanced) Generate an array of 40 random numbers from 1 to 300.
Find the longest increasing subsequence (not necessarily consecutive) in the array.
Output its length and the subsequence itself. */

/* 15. (Advanced) Generate a 3D array of size 3x3x3, where each value is a random integer from 5 to 25.
Find the maximum value in the 3D array and its coordinates (all positions where it occurs). */
