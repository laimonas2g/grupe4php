/* Arrays - 15 Exercises (from easy to advanced) */

/* 1. Generate an array of 40 elements (indices from 0 to 39) with random values from 10 to 50. */

/* 2. Using the array from exercise 1: */

/* 2. a) Count how many values in the array are less than or equal to 25. */

/* 2. b) Find the smallest value in the array and its index or indices (if there are several). */

/* 2. c) Calculate the sum of values at odd indices. */

/* 2. d) Create a new array where each value is the corresponding value from exercise 1 multiplied by its index. */

/* 2. e) Extend the array with 15 more elements with values from 10 to 50, 
so that the total number of elements is 55. */

/* 2. f) Create two new arrays: one containing values with indices divisible by 3, 
and another with the remaining values. */

/* 2. g) Set all values with indices divisible by 4 to -1 if they are less than 20. */

/* 2. h) Find the last (largest) index with a value greater than 30. */

/* 2. i) Use unset() to delete all elements whose indices are divisible by 5. */

/* 3. Generate an array of 300 elements, where each value is a random lowercase letter ('a' to 'f'). 
Count how many times each letter occurs. */

/* 4. Sort the array from exercise 3 in reverse alphabetical order. */

/* 5. Generate three arrays as in exercise 3. Combine the arrays by concatenating their values in order, 
then count how many unique letters and unique 3-letter combinations there are. */

/* 6. Generate two arrays of 150 unique random integers from 200 to 999 (inclusive). */

/* 7. Generate an array from values that appear in the first array of exercise 6 but not in the second. */

/* 8. Generate an array of values that appear in both arrays from exercise 6. */

/* 9. Create an associative array where keys are values from the first array of exercise 6, 
and values are from the second array (by position). If arrays are of different lengths, stop at the shorter one. */

/* 10. Generate a 15-element array with the following rule: The first two numbers are random from 10 to 30.
Each next number is the product of the previous two. */

/* 11. Generate a 121-element array of random numbers from 0 to 500. 
Regenerate values that are not unique so that all values are unique. 
Sort the array so that the largest value is at the center, 
and the values decrease as you move towards the start and end of the array.
Calculate the sum of the first and second halves of the array (excluding the middle value).
If the absolute difference between the sums is greater than 40, repeat the sorting until it's not. */

/* 12. (Advanced) Generate a 2D array (10x10) where each element is a random number from 1 to 100. 
Find the sum of each row and each column. */

/* 13. (Advanced) Create an array of 50 random numbers from 1 to 100. 
Create a new array where each value is the average of that value and its neighbors (previous and next).
For the first and last elements, use only two neighbors (self and next/previous). */

/* 14. (Advanced) Generate an array of 100 random numbers from 1 to 1000. 
Find the longest increasing subsequence (not necessarily consecutive) in the array. 
Output its length and the subsequence itself. */

/* 15. (Advanced) Generate a 3D array of size 5x5x5, where each value is a random integer from 1 to 20. 
Find the maximum value in the 3D array and its coordinates (all positions where it occurs). */
