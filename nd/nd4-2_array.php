/* Arrays - 15 New Exercises (from easy to advanced) */

/* 1. Create an array of 30 elements (indices from 0 to 29) with random values from 1 to 100. */

/* 2. Using the array from exercise 1: */

/* 2. a) Count how many values in the array are even numbers. */

/* 2. b) Find the largest value in the array and its index or indices (if there are several). */

/* 2. c) Calculate the average value of all elements in the array. */

/* 2. d) Create a new array where each value is the sum of the corresponding value from exercise 1 and its index. */

/* 2. e) Add 10 more elements with random values from 1 to 100 to the array, so the total number of elements is 40. */

/* 2. f) Create two new arrays: one with values at indices that are odd, and one with values at indices that are even. */

/* 2. g) Change all values with indices divisible by 6 to 0 if they are greater than 50. */

/* 2. h) Find the first index with a value less than 20. */

/* 2. i) Use unset() to remove all elements whose indices are divisible by 7. */

/* 3. Generate an array of 200 elements, where each value is a random uppercase letter ('A' to 'E').
Count how many times each letter occurs. */

/* 4. Sort the array from exercise 3 in alphabetical order. */

/* 5. Generate two arrays as in exercise 3. Merge both arrays, then count how many unique letters and unique 2-letter combinations exist. */

/* 6. Generate two arrays of 100 unique random integers from 500 to 999 (inclusive). */

/* 7. Generate an array with values that appear only in the second array of exercise 6 but not in the first. */

/* 8. Generate an array of values that appear in both arrays from exercise 6. */

/* 9. Create an associative array where keys are values from the second array of exercise 6,
and values are from the first array (by position). If arrays are of different lengths, stop at the shorter one. */

/* 10. Generate a 12-element array with the following rule: The first number is random from 5 to 15.
Each next number is the previous number plus a random number from 1 to 5. */

/* 11. Generate a 50-element array of random numbers from 1 to 100.
Replace any duplicate values so that all elements are unique.
Sort the array in ascending order. Calculate the product of the first and last elements. */

/* 12. (Advanced) Generate a 2D array (8x8) where each value is a random number from 1 to 50.
Find the maximum and minimum value in each row and column. */

/* 13. (Advanced) Create an array of 30 random numbers from 1 to 50.
Create a new array where each value is the sum of itself and its left and right neighbor.
For the first and last elements, use only two values (self and neighbor). */

/* 14. (Advanced) Generate an array of 60 random numbers from 1 to 500.
Find the longest decreasing subsequence (not necessarily consecutive) in the array.
Output its length and the subsequence itself. */

/* 15. (Advanced) Generate a 3D array of size 4x4x4, where each value is a random integer from 1 to 15.
Find the minimum value in the 3D array and its coordinates (all positions where it occurs). */
