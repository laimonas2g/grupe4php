/* Loops and Patterns Exercises */

/* 1. Print a horizontal line of 500 “#” symbols. 
   Break the line into multiple lines programmatically so that no line contains more than 60 “#” symbols. */

/* 2. Generate 350 random numbers from 1 to 400. Print them separated by commas.
   Count how many are even and display the count. Numbers greater than 350 should be displayed in blue. */

/* 3. Print all numbers from 1 to a random number between 3500 and 4500,
   that are divisible by 63 without a remainder. Separate numbers with semicolons. 
   Make sure there is no semicolon at the end. */

/* 4. Draw a rectangle of “@” symbols, where the sides are 80 and 40 “@” symbols long.
   Use CSS to make sure it looks like a proper rectangle on the screen. */

/* 5. Draw both diagonals of the rectangle from exercise 4 using green “@” symbols. */

/* 6. Simulate rolling a die using rand(). If a 6 comes up, stop rolling. 
   Print each result on a new line. Repeat for the following scenarios:
   a) Stop after getting the first 6.
   b) Stop after getting a total of four 6s.
   c) Stop after getting three 6s in a row. */

/* 7. Alice and Bob play a game. Alice scores 8-18 points per round, Bob scores 12-22 points.
   Print each player's points for each round and announce the winner of the round.
   The winner is the first to reach or exceed 200 points. Repeat rounds until that happens.
   Do not use break in the loop. */

/* 8. Draw a filled triangle of “$” symbols with a height of 25 lines.
   Each row should be colored with a different random RGB color. */

/* 9. Create a colorful 10x10 grid, where each cell is 25x25px. 
   Alternate between random pastel colors and random neon colors for each cell.
   Colors should change every page reload. */

/* 10. Simulate hammering 3 nails with variable strength hits. 
    Each hit drives the nail in by 7-25 mm. Nail length is 7.8 cm.
    Count how many hits are needed for each nail. */

/* 11. Simulate hammering 3 nails with “miss chance”. 
    Each hit drives the nail in by 15-35 mm, but there’s a 40% chance to miss the nail.
    Count and print the number of hits (including misses) for each nail. */

/* 12. Generate a string of 40 unique random numbers from 10 to 180, separated by spaces.
    Create a second string containing only the perfect squares from the first string, sorted in ascending order. */

/* 13. Print a multiplication table from 1 to 12, formatted as an HTML table with CSS for neat borders and cell spacing. */

/* 14. Create a function that takes two parameters: the number of rows and columns, 
    and prints a “zigzag” pattern using “X” and “O”, alternating each row. 
    (e.g. row1: XOXO..., row2: OXOX..., etc.) */

/* 15. Print all prime numbers between 100 and 1000, but only those where the sum of the digits is also prime.
    Print the numbers separated by spaces. */

/* Advanced Exercises */

/* 16. Draw a hollow diamond pattern with “+” symbols and a height of 31 lines.
   Only the outline of the diamond should be visible. Each outline “+” should have a random color. */

/* 17. Create a function to generate a magic square of size N (N odd, 3 <= N <= 11).
   Print the square as a formatted HTML table. */

/* 18. Write code that simulates 1000 coin tosses and prints the longest sequence of consecutive heads (“H”) and tails (“T”).
   Output both sequences and their lengths. */

/* 19. Generate 100 random numbers between 1000 and 9999. 
   Find and display the longest increasing subsequence (not necessarily consecutive) in the sequence. */

/* 20. Implement Conway’s Game of Life on a 30x30 grid, randomly initializing the starting state.
   Display the grid for 5 generations using colored HTML blocks. */
