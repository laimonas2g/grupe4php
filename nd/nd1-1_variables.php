/* Variables and Conditions */

/* 1. Use the rand() function. Create two variables and assign them random values between 1 and 10. 
Output their sum, difference, product, and quotient (rounded to 2 decimal places). */



/* 2. Use the rand() function. Create three variables with random values from 0 to 100. 
Print out the largest and the smallest of the three numbers. */

/* 3. Use the rand() function. Generate a random integer between 1 and 7. 
Print the day of the week corresponding to that number (1 - Monday, 7 - Sunday). */

/* 4. Create two variables with random values from -20 to 20. 
Print both numbers and state which one is closer to zero. If both are equally close, state so. */

/* 5. Use the rand() function to generate four variables with values between 1 and 100. 
Calculate and print only the even numbers among them. */

/* 6. Generate a random number from 0 to 255. 
Print the number as a hexadecimal color code (e.g., #00FF00), 
and display a small colored square using inline CSS. */

/* 7. Create three random variables (from 1 to 100). 
Print all three and check if they can form the sides of a right triangle. Output the result. */

/* 8. Generate two random integers between 1 and 12. 
Print a multiplication table row for those numbers (e.g., 3 x 7 = 21). */

/* 9. Generate a random year between 1582 and 2100. 
Print whether that year is a leap year. */

/* 10. Create five random variables (from 0 to 10). 
Print all variables and count how many of them are odd numbers. */

/* 11. Generate a random hour (0-23) and minute (0-59). 
Print the time and state if it is AM or PM. */

/* 12. Generate four random numbers (from 1 to 100). 
Sort and print them in descending order, separated by commas. (Do NOT use arrays or loops.) */

/* 13. Use rand() to generate three random numbers (from 1 to 50). 
Print their sum. If the sum is even, print "Even sum"; if odd, print "Odd sum". */

/* 14. Generate a random number between 1000 and 9999. 
Print the number and state whether all its digits are unique. */

/* 15. Advanced. Simulate rolling two dice (random numbers 1-6). 
Print both results and the sum. If both dice show the same number, print "Double!"; 
if the sum is 7 or 11, print "Lucky!". */

/* 16. Advanced. Generate three random angles (from 1 to 178). 
Print them and check if they can form a triangle (the sum must be 180). 
If so, state the type of triangle (acute, obtuse, right). */

/* 17. Advanced. Generate two random times (hours and minutes, 0-23, 0-59). 
Print both times and calculate the difference in minutes between them. */

/* 18. Advanced. Generate a random number between 1 and 10000. 
Print the number and the sum of its digits. Also, print whether the sum is even or odd. */

/* 19. Advanced. Generate six random numbers from 10 to 99. 
Print them in a single line, separated by spaces, from smallest to largest (no arrays or loops). */

/* 20. Advanced. Generate a random 4-digit pin code (from 1000 to 9999). 
Print the code and a masked version (e.g., if the code is 5372, print *3*2). 
Only print the second and fourth digits, masking the first and third with * characters. */
